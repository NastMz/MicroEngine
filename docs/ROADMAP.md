## Development Philosophy

The roadmap follows these core principles:

### Iterate Quickly Early

-   Build feedback loops with working prototypes
-   Validate architecture decisions with real implementations
-   Fail fast and learn from mistakes
-   Release early, release often during pre-1.0 development

### Stabilize Late

-   API changes are allowed and expected before 1.0.0
-   Breaking changes are discouraged but acceptable if justified
-   User feedback shapes the API during 0.x versions
-   Freeze API only when it has been battle-tested

### Deliver Real Value Early

-   Each version must provide tangible functionality
-   Backends and sample games demonstrate real-world usage
-   Documentation accompanies every feature
-   No "placeholder" implementations

### Avoid Premature Complexity

-   Start simple, expand later
-   3D support comes only after 2D is mature and stable
-   Advanced features require solid foundations
-   Resist feature creep during early phases

### Allow Future Growth

-   Architecture decisions consider long-term extensibility
-   Abstractions designed for multiple implementations
-   No hardcoded assumptions about dimensionality
-   Plugin system supports custom backends and extensions

---

## Acceptance Criteria

-   ✅ Integration tests cover major workflows
-   ✅ No failing tests in CI/CD pipeline
-   ✅ Performance benchmarks meet targets

### Documentation

-   ✅ All public APIs documented with XML comments
-   ✅ User-facing guides updated
-   ✅ Architecture documents reflect current state

### Security & Stability

-   ✅ No critical vulnerabilities

## Final Notes

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve based on:

-   User feedback and community contributions
-   Technical discoveries during implementation
-   Changing requirements and priorities
-   New opportunities and technologies

However, the core philosophy and architectural principles remain fixed:

-   **Dimension-agnostic design**
-   **Backend independence**
-   **Deterministic behavior**
-   **Modular architecture**
-   **Long-term maintainability**

The roadmap provides a clear long-term vision while remaining flexible enough to adapt to real-world development needs.
