# MicroEngine engineering foundation

This is the active context for the greenfield C#/.NET 2D framework.

## Start here

1. Read [manifesto](manifesto.md) and [requirements](requirements.md).
2. Read [accepted decisions](decisions/README.md).
3. Check [roadmap](roadmap.md), [contributing](contributing.md) and [document policy](document-policy.md).
4. Consult [history](history.md) for the retired prototype.

## Current state — 2026-10-12

The owner approved the repository transition. The historical prototype is preserved at
`legacy-final`, not present as active projects. No new engine implementation, backend,
solution or test runner exists. ECS, DI, rendering and other technical choices remain open.
ADR-0001 records approved product direction, not an approved engine architecture.

## Templates

- [ADR](templates/adr.md): significant alternatives and explicit approval.
- [Capability](templates/capability.md): behavior, conceptual contracts and verification.
- [Milestone](templates/milestone.md): bounded external validation scenario.

Create actual specs only for concrete scope. The owner is the approval authority unless
explicit delegation is recorded. A generated recommendation does not approve itself.
